modulantis nota poete.'' They torm the pretece to 1
poem addrsseed 1011311011, Bishop of Lindisfsrne (803-
811) by AEtbelwult. . . ,The verses end attho bottom
ottho pege, and no doubt the whole poem followed on
leaves now missing. There is however reason to believe
1101 they are in the British Museum in MS. Oott Tib. D.
iv. ff. 309·318. 'l'hese leaves, which have nothing to do
with the rest ot the MS. (Lives of Saints oi the twelfth
0011) with which they are bound up, contain the poem
oi AEthelwuli, without the prefatory lines, and beginning
01 the top ot the pege. Allowing for the injury done to
them bytho fiis oi 1731, they are oi the samo dimensione
ss the Winchester MS„ and the hand . . . appears to be
identical with that of the lines in the latter volume!

1 cannot see that there is anything which thmws light
on the history oi the MS. Dr. Kitchin thought thet it
had been originally a Glastonbury book ¹. 0„ as I shall
show presently‚ is a transcript of this MS„ though, owing
to the insertion iu it of iv. 14, Iam obliged to place it in
tbe class oi conflate MSS. ; but as regards origin, 0, and
derivatives 01 0, iii any), must be reokoned as belonging
to the Winchester group.
