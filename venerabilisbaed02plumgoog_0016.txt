MS.. but also in the MS. belonging to Pembroke
College, Cambridge. It ie one os the many pleasures
connected with this work that it has brought me the
privilege of his friendship. In relation to the last-
named MS. I have to aeknowledge the courtesy of
the College Librarian‚ hlr. Neil.

At the British Museum my special thanks are due
to hlr. F. Biekley, not only sor constant help in my
researches, hut sor sending me written information
on various points whenI was prevented by illness
from going up to London mysels. The Dean and
Chapter of Durham kindly allowed their MS. of Bede
to be deposited in the Bodleian for my use3 to them
and to their learned Librarian, Dr W. Greenwell, my
best thanks are due. I am also indebted to my
brother, Dr. A. Plummer‚ sor verifying lor me some
points which Ι had overlooked. A like service was
done me at Winehester hy the Librarian‚ the Rev.
F. T. hladga My original examination of the Win-
chester MS. was made under the hospitahle roof of
my dear friend, Dr. Kitehin, now transferred to a
aphere os wider usefulness at Durham. At Namur
special facilities were given me by the director and
librarian of the municipal library and museum,
hl. Becket and Μ. hlahieu.

To the Delegates of the Clarendon Press I am in·
dehted for entrueting me with the execution ol this
edition. which has occupied my chief energies for
some four years. Itis no light privilege to have
been for so long a time in constant communion with
one of the saintliest characters ever produced hythe
Church of Christ in this island. I ean but adapt the
words oi St. Ignatius, and say: εὔχομαι μὴ ele μαρτύριον
οὔτὸ κτήσωμαι (Philad c. 6).
