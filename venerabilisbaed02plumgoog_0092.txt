Smith’s text that subsequent editors have practically
been content to reproduce it and very little hasbeen
done for the textunl criticism of Bede since 1722.

Stevenson (1841) is little but a reprint oi Smith’s text stevenso
without his critical notes¹ ; though in his preface
*pp xxxiii ff.) he says that he basod his text on M,
coluting ‘where necessary’ the MSS. which Ι have
exiled B, O, H„ Bri and ‘occasionally consulting‘

Giles (1843) corrected some of Smith’s errors, chiefly, eires
it would seem, by reference to the Heidelberg edition
in the Scriptores Rerum Britannicarum, 1587 ; and
'referred to’ other MSS!

Hnaeey (184⁶) used Smith's text ‘inspectis nonnun· lium.

which he names are Μ and Ι); the former oi which
sCsmbridge friend collated for him in places. The
latter iscited once, p. 87. He else used the editions ot
Stei'euson and Giles, and compared some other sources
lor the documento, tre, contained in the H. E. The
AngleSaxon version is occasionally cited.
