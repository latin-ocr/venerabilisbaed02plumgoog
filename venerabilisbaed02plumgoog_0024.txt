Beda? Why cemes he not to the prescribed devotione
rn'th the brethren¹⁴?”' And in the commentar-y on
St Luke, he says: ‘Whenever we enter the Ohurch, and
dnn near to the heavenly mysteries, we ought to approach
with all humility and sear, as well because of the pre·
senes ol the angelic powers, as of the reverence due to
the sacred oblation 3 for ss the angels are narnuted to have
stood hythe Lord's body when it lay in the tomb, so we
must believe that they are present in the celebratien of
the mysteries of His most sacred body at the time of
consecration ¹.’ In the same spirit ol devotion, comment·
ing on St. Mark’s narrative, where our Lord, alter the
triumphal entry into Jerusalem, goes to the temple, he
ssys: ‘So we when we come te any town or village in
which there is a house of prayer dedicated to God, first
turn aeide to this, and, when we have commended our·
selres to Ged in prayer, then go about the worldly busi-
ness for which we came ³.' And perhaps seme of us hsve

known the refreshment of entering the silence os some
great cathedral, or the quiet es seme village church, alter
sweary journey, or a dusty welk, and there composing
our thoughts a while in peuce ⁴.
