the Ctext of two later annale, 733 and 734, seems to
show that that recension was made in the latter yesr;
and as the death ol Archbishop Tatwin is not mentioned
in that part ol the 734 annal which is embodied in the
t'text, it is probable that that recension was made before
July 30, 734, the date of Tatwin's death. Morcover the
