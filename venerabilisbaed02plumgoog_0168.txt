he could hardly fail to do, hui Beda written n peuitentid.
Η. R S. iii. 418.

Anothur stet which points the same way iu that Bede,
who says so much about the work of Theodoro, never
even alludes 10 his penitential, which, ennaidering its
importante, would eenaiuly be strange if he wem himself
intemted in such liter-ture ².

The penitentis! ascribed to Beda is n mere mollection os

is conntnined to ask why Bonis should luva made such
