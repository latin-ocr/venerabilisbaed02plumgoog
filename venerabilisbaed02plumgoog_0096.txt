which may be taken to represent fairly the Latin ortho-

(H) is so much earlier than all the rest³, I have repro

In addition to the four MSS. which have been collated
throughout, numerous MSS, especially in Oxford and
the British Museum, have been examined and collated
in certain test passages. 'I'he object of this examination
has been chiefly to investigate the relatione of these
