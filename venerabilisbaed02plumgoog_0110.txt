note 9, ‘depraecessorI’ for ⁴ praedecessori,’ p. 295, note 5,
&c (3) But the most decisivo evidence of copying is
given by those instances in which the scribe of H, has
misintsrpmted the reading of M. Thus, p. 253, Μ reads
‘sd 'calcariam 'ciuitatem q:· (quae),’ meaning that ‘calc’
end ‘cim' are to be transposed H, perceives this, but
mideking ‘qs' for the conjunction ‘que’ transposes it
also, and reads ‘ciuitatemque calcariam‚' which makes
nonsenso. Again, in v. 24, annal 538: ‘eclipsis solis ...
ab hore prime usquead tertiam,’ Μ accidentally omits
‘solis’ then adds it on the margin at the end of the line
witha mark of insertion after ‘eclipsis’ H, overlooks
this mark, and copying mechanically reads: ‘eclipsis . . .
ab hors prima usque ad tertiam solis ².’ (4) Α further
proof of the connexion of the two MSS. is afforded by
the extrscts which follow the Η. Ε. These are identical
with those which occur at the end of M, as far as these
letter, which are mutilated‚ g0; viz. Isidoro on Con·
