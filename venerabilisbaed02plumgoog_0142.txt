Bede’s collected works, which was itself reprinted 1688.
In 1681 01111661 the Jesuit published his edition oi
Bede's H. E. under 1116 11116 ‘Bedae Presbyteri et Frede-
51111 scholastici concordia' 416, Paris For this he used
‘H Maximini Treuerensis codex peruetustus¹,’ a MS.
which Hardy¹ identifies with MS. Phillips, 1873, an'd
believes to be a transcript of bl. Certainly Ghifflet‘s text
is of the lii-type. At the end oi the work, after ‘faciem
tuam,’ Ohifflet gives from the printed editions the
continuation of Bede’s Chronology. This he believes
to be mainly the work ol Bede himself, whose death he
places in 761 (l). In addition 16 these continental editions,
Giles’ mentions an edition of the H. E. at Lyons in 1587,
and collected editions oi Bede's works at Paris in 1544
and 1554. Hardy⁴ further gives the following editions :
1483, Strasburg; 1493, Spires; 1514, Strasburg; 1545,
Paris, 1661, 06165661.

16 164 3-4 Abraham Wheloclr published, at Cambridge,
the first English edition of the Latin textos the H. E,
and the editio princeps oi the Anglo·Saxon version. He
probably took his Latin text mainly from one oi the
continental editions, but he used also three MSS„ one
belonging to sir Robert Cotton, one to Dr. Ward of
Sidney Snssex College, and one to Trinity 0611656,
Cambridge ⁸. In 1711 appeared Smith’s edition, already
described, which at once superseded all others
