abbat was part of the monastic rule¹. And Bede gives
abesutiful account of the gracious and saintly lact with
which men like Cuthbert‚ Eosterwine‚ and Ceolirid
managed their sometimes troubleeome floeks'. Inter-
views with the abbot or prior provoked, no doubt, the
same sort of speculation and comment as interviews
sith the president or dean of a college do now. Only

v the penalties inflicted would be different. General
monitione were given by the prior or abbot in an
assembly of all the monks³‚ and subjecte of common
interest were debated there ⁴.
