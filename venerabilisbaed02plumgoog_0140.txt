relations ol this version to the original do not concern us
here. They are matters for an editor of that version.
The only question with which an editor of the Latin
text is concerned is the bearing ol the AngloSaxon
version on that text Owing to the freedom with which
the translator worked, the AS. version is very rarely
arailable ior the settlement of minute differences of
reading. But the general type ol text used by the
translator is perfectly plain Owing to the omission of
the chronological summary, test 4 cannot be applied;
but the other tour testa show that he used ausos the
C·type And it was a good and pure MS. of that type.
The As version shows no trace either ol the unauthorised
additions of later MSS„ or of the special peculiarities of
the Durham or Winchester group. Other points in
which it shows its affiuity with O are the joining together
of iii. 1 and 2, and ,the reading ‘unum quod’ lor ‘quae-
dam quae' at the eud of iv. 28 (30). In one or two
points the translator’s MS. was superior to our C; it did
not omit ‘signando’ at the end of iv. 22 (24), or ‘ rationis’
at the end of v. 21. It differs irom O and the majority
ot C'e followers, and agrees with Μ in making iii. 13
begin, ‘Neo solum inclyti fama uiri,' instead ol ‘Tempore
inquit, mortalitatis’3 but other MSS„ not of the Mtype,
do the same
ξ 38. A few words must be said in conclusion as to aarum

early editions. 'I'he editio princeps ol the H. E. is ‘¹⁰⁰⁸'
without printer’s name or place, but it iscertaiuly¹ the
work oi Heinrich Eggesteyn of strasburg, and was
probably printed about 1475. 0f v. ²4 it omits all after
the words ‘adiecit imperio,' p. 352, l. 135 so that teste
