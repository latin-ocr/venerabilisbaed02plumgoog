The laet that the inserted matter has mainly to do
with wilfrid shows that the origin ot this MS. must be
northern. The key to tho position lies in an entry under
the year 667: ff abb. sori (‘ noster abbas scripsit ').
who was tho northern abbot about ⁶⁶7 whose writings
were so important as to deservo a special entry? The
answer to that question would fix the looality ot the
parant Ma ol these two groups. The evident interest in
Wilfrid suggests Hexham‚ Ripon‚ York, or possibly
lindisfarne? Can it refer to the writing of the great
lindisfarne Gospels by Eadlrid¹? 1f so, the date is
probably placed too early.

of the two groups, the D group is mueh nearer toC
than the W group. This is not surprising, sseing that
lbave already given reasons for believing that C it'seli is
aLindisfarne or Durham boola This greater nearness
oiI) to C is shown by the fairly numerous instances in
which they agree together against W. The following
may serve as specimens: ‘itaque' C, D, p. 42, note 4, ‘iam-
que' W; ‘eonuersione,' C, D, p. 106, note 3, ‘conuersa-
tione’ W3 ‘cognoscuntur‚’C, D, p. 84, note 3, ‘noscuntur‚'
W; ‘uocatur’ C, D, p. 253, note 9, ‘appellatur,' W;
‘hautun’ Ο, D, p. 286, note 7, ‘uocabatur’ W; ‘institu-
tionis' C, D, p. 332, note 3, ‘institutis’ W.

For this reason I take the Durbam group first in order.
